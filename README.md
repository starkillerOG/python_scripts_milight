# python_scripts_milight
Python scripts that act as extensions to the ESP milight hub.

These scripts need to be run with python 2 (2.7 for instance), python 3 will not work due to the ast.literal_eval working diffrently in python 3.

These scripts are tested on a raspberry pi 3 that is also running HomeAssistant.
All modules listed under "import modules" schould be installed (using pip or pip3) in order for these scripts to work.
